"The screenshot displays the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to my personal computer, which is a unique numerical identifier that enables it to communicate with other devices on the internet. This IP address is specific to my computer and distinguishes it from other devices, allowing it to send and receive information over the internet. As such, the screenshot captures an important aspect of my digital identity, as it reveals my computer's online location and can be used to track my internet activity."

To verify the location in which I created a virtual machine, we went through the process of creating the machine and remotely accessing it. This involved setting up a virtual environment and accessing it from a remote location to confirm its location. In addition to this, we also retrieved the virtual machine's unique IP address, which serves as a unique identifier for the machine on the network.

"We have achieved the successful download and installation of ProtonVPN, a virtual private network (VPN) software, onto our virtual machine. This software offers a secure and private network connection that helps protect our online activities and sensitive information.</p>

"Now that we have successfully downloaded ProtonVPN onto our virtual machine, we will proceed to connect to a server located in Japan, using the software. This will allow us to make several observations related to the network connectivity and performance of the VPN service. By establishing a secure and private connection to a server in Japan, we will gain access to region-specific content and resources, while also evaluating the speed and reliability of the VPN service </p>
